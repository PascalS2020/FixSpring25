# PCM Heat Flux MATLAB Model

This MATLAB model simulates transient heat flux through a wall system containing a Phase Change Material (PCM) layer. It tracks temperature, heat flow, and phase transitions based on real-world weather data and material properties.

## Files Required

Place all files in the same directory before running the model.

- `PCM_HeatFlux_Model_Spring25_Final_1.m` – Main simulation script
- `PCM_Running_List.xlsx` – Contains thermal and physical properties of different PCMs
- `TemperatureDataCity.xlsx` – Hourly temperature profiles for various cities

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open MATLAB.**
2. **Set the working directory** to the folder containing all three files.
3. Open the script `PCM_HeatFlux_Model_Spring25_Final_1.m`.
4. Run the script (F5 or green play button).
5. You will be prompted to input:
   - **PCM Name**: e.g., `PCM18` (must exactly match a column header in `PCM_Running_List.xlsx`)
   - **City and Date**: e.g., `Austin 03.14.2024`

---

## Input Format

- **PCM Name**: Must match a column name from `PCM_Running_List.xlsx`. This selects which PCM properties to simulate.
- **City and Date**: Format exactly as `"CityName DD.MM.YYYY"` (e.g., `"Austin 21.07.2023"`). Must match entries in `TemperatureDataCity.xlsx`.

## Model Overview

- Wall layers: Limestone (left), PCM (center), Drywall (right)
- Assumes:
  - 10 m² wall area
  - 24-hour simulation with 1-second time steps
- Simulates heat transfer and PCM behavior (solid, melting, liquid) in response to outside temperatures

---

## Output

After simulation, the model displays:

- A 6-panel figure with plots for:
  - Melt percentage over time
  - PCM temperature
  - Outside temperature
  - Net heat flux through the wall
  - Summary statistics (energy stored, max temp, etc.)
- A MATLAB table (`viewdata`) with detailed per-second results:
  - PCM temperature
  - % melted
  - Left and right side heat flow
  - Net heat flow
  - Outside temperature

---

## Notes

- Units:
  - Temperatures: °C
  - Heat flux: W/m²
  - Energy stored: kJ
- If the PCM name or date is not found, the model will raise an error.
- PCM transitions are handled by latent heat logic. Ensure correct property values in the Excel file.

## Help

If errors occur, ensure:
- All files are in the same folder
- Excel files are formatted correctly
- Inputs match expected values (case-sensitive)
